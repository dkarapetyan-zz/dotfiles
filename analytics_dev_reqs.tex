\section{Developer \#1 (Assisting more with Algorithms Code)}
\subsection{Education}
\begin{enumerate}[a)]
	\item
		Ideally, someone from \textbf{MIT, Berkeley, Carnegie Mellon, Princeton}, or other
		top-ranked technical schools with an \textbf{undergraduate degree in
		computer science}. 
		Paying even \textbf{above market rate} for someone like that would pay off in the
		long term. 
	\item\label{itm:crit1} If there are a shortage of candidates, and we must be practical, then
		what becomes important is that the candidate have an \textbf{undergraduate
		degree in CS} from a top-25-school: \\
		\href{}{http://colleges.usnews.rankingsandreviews.com/best-colleges/rankings/national-universities}
	\item\label{itm:crit2} Theoretical knowledge of \textbf{data structures}, and lower level languages like
		\textbf{Assembly} or \textbf{C/C++}. Experience with \textbf{Python}

\end{enumerate}

The work in \textbf{analytics is different from a regular developer
job}: if a co-worker makes even a small mistake in code, or is a bit sloppy,
the forecasts can be way off, the code will run very slowly, or both. Being able to trust them is paramount; otherwise, they are just overhead.
