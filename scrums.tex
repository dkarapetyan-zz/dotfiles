\begin{enumerate}
	\item Unless turnstiles are at the bank level, won't know which sector of 
	building people are going to based on turnstiles.
	\item 32, 80 Pine are some of 
	those where turnstiles DO tell us which sector of building people are 
	headed to, which will be critical for interior space temperature 
	predictions via occupancy)
	\item Some turnstiles only have ``In'', not an ``Out''--they're just gates 
	with an ``open'' and ``closed'' switched
	\item Have access to Mongo University (on Rudin's dime)
	\item Neal wants database searches via frontend (remember, dynamic 
	variables via RShiny--give list of variables for choice two based on choice 
	of building for choice one, etc.)
	\item Final DiBoss will give whether elevators are running, start-up time, 
	report generation 
	\item Alerts entirely from BMS, filtered out by Columbia/Selex with input 
	from Rudin engineers
